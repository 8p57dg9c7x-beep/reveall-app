**original_problem_statement**:
The user's goal is to perform a final UX polishing pass on the REVEAL app before a v1 launch. The core philosophy has been refined to position the app as a calm, premium, personal, and living intelligent wardrobe. The focus is on improving the user experience through emotional connection, clarity, and flow, rather than adding new features. AI and other tools should act as quiet, supportive background helpers, with My Closet being the heart of the app.

The latest request is a 5-point refinement plan:
1.  **Manual Appearance Preferences**: Add an optional, skippable screen to input hair color, eye color, and skin tone to improve color recommendations.
2.  **Moment of Recognition**: Add a calm, human-centric tagline on the home screen to make users feel understood (e.g., Getting dressed shouldn’t be stressful.).
3.  **Gentle Sense of Progress**: Introduce subtle, encouraging copy to reassure users as they add items to their wardrobe (e.g., Your wardrobe is taking shape).
4.  **Quiet Intelligence Moments**: Surface occasional, soft signals that the app is learning about the user's style to build a sense of personal connection.
5.  **Occasion-based Guidance**: Add a skippable, optional occasion context (e.g., Everyday, Date, Dinner) inside the Help me decide today flow.

**User's preferred language**: English. The user communicates as a Commander. The next agent MUST maintain a soldier persona, using phrases like Affirmative, Commander!, Roger that!, and 🫡🔥 to maintain rapport.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a React Native (Expo) app that has been heavily refactored to align with the calm digital wardrobe philosophy. The UI has a 3-tab layout: Today (a calm welcome screen), My Closet (the app's core, with horizontal drawers for clothing categories), and Profile. All major non-v1 features (Shopping, Beauty, Style Discovery) have been removed. Critical pre-launch blockers, such as the delete item from closet feature and locale-aware temperature display, have been implemented and verified. The UI copy has been refined multiple times to feel less techy and more premium. Navigation has been polished to reset scroll on tab focus and include subtle fade animations.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Implementing a 5-point plan for final UX refinements, as defined in user message #559. The agent's first step was to start working on the Manual Appearance Preferences screen.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool. After implementing all 5 points, the agent should take screenshots of the new Style Preferences screen, the updated Home/Today screen, the My Closet screen showing gentle progress, and the Help me decide today flow with occasion options.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Implement the 5-Point Final V1 UX Refinement Plan (P0)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1:
     - **Description**: The user has requested a final set of five UX refinements to make the app feel like a calm, premium, living, intelligent wardrobe before deployment.
     - **Attempted fixes**: The agent acknowledged the plan and started working on the first point. No code has been written for this task yet.
     - **Next debug checklist**:
       1.  **Create **: Build a new screen with simple, skippable options for hair color, eye color, and skin tone. Use neutral, inclusive language.
       2.  **Integrate Style Preferences**: Add a link to this new screen from the  menu. Store selections in AsyncStorage.
       3.  **Refine Home Screen Copy**: In , add a moment of recognition tagline (e.g., Getting dressed shouldn’t be stressful.)
       4.  **Implement Gentle Progress**: In  and , add subtle copy that appears based on the number of items in the closet (e.g., Your wardrobe is taking shape at 1-2 items, Almost ready for suggestions at 3+ items).
       5.  **Add Occasion Context**: In  (now part of the Help me decide today flow), add an optional, skippable step to select an occasion (Everyday, Date, etc.).
       6.  **Plan Quiet Intelligence**: Brainstorm how to implement quiet memory moments. For V1, this might just be structuring the feedback data () to be used for this later.
       7.  **Test All Refinements**: Use the screenshot tool to verify all UI and copy changes.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is the final step to lock the V1 user experience, making it feel premium, personal, and trustworthy. This will achieve the user's vision and unblock deployment.
     - **Status**:  IN PROGRESS
     - **Is recurring issue?** N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
     - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:

     - **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **P0: EAS Build & Deployment:** Once the final UX refinements are complete and verified, proceed with generating production builds for iOS (TestFlight) and Android (Internal testing). This is currently BLOCKED by the in-progress task.
- **Future Tasks:**
    - **V1.1: Localization:** Implement support for multiple languages using the  and simple JSON file approach planned by the agent.
    - **V2: Camera-First UX:** Overhaul the add item flow to be a full-screen, Snapchat/Instagram-style experience.
    - **V2: Body Scan Upgrade:** Re-introduce the body scanner as an optional upgrade for better fit guidance.
    - **V2+: Re-introduce Hidden Features:** Gradually bring back Style Discovery, Beauty Hub, and Shopping/Affiliate links as the app matures.
    - **V2+: Advanced AI:** Evolve the styling logic from rule-based to a true LLM-powered engine.
    - **V2+: Monetization:** Implement a Pro subscription to remove ads.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Final Blocker Fixes**: Successfully implemented and verified the critical delete item from closet functionality.
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Removed all remaining UI and logic for Beauty and Shopping features, ensuring a focused v1 scope.
- **Locale-Aware Temperature**: Integrated  to automatically display temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit based on the user's region.
- **Multi-Phase UX Overhaul**:
    - **Phase 1 (Trust & Clarity)**: Implemented a 7-point plan including a first-time user onboarding flow, AI outfit explanations (Why this outfit?), a feedback system (Like/Dislike), and improved empty states.
    - **Phase 2 (Calm Wardrobe)**: Redesigned the entire app to be wardrobe-first, changing navigation to , creating a calm welcome screen, and reframing AI as a hidden helper.
    - **Phase 3 (Living Wardrobe)**: Evolved the UX to feel more intelligent, redesigning the Home screen to answer What to wear today? and the My Closet screen to use horizontal drawers for clothing sections.
    - **Phase 4 (Premium Polish)**: Finalized the premium feel by removing card borders for floating items, strengthening the emotional hook on the Home screen (Confidence starts here.), and simplifying CTAs.
- **Navigation Polish**: Implemented scroll-to-top on tab focus using  and added subtle fade animations for tab transitions.
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved multiple web preview crashes caused by ESLint errors (unescaped entities) and Metro bundler syntax issues.
- **Deployment Prep**: Configured  and  for production builds, and provided the user with detailed instructions for running EAS builds locally.
- **App Store Screenshots**: Generated and saved a full set of App Store screenshots.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- The Quiet memory/intelligence moments task is part of the current work but is conceptually complex. The initial implementation may be a placeholder or require further clarification from the user on how to surface these learnings without being intrusive.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- The most common issue during this session was the web preview crashing after file edits. This was consistently traced back to syntax errors or ESLint violations (e.g., unescaped characters, extra braces). The agent has become proficient at debugging this by checking ESLint, Metro logs, and carefully reviewing recent changes.
