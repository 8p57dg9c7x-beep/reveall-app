The trajectory documents an extensive period of development for the REVEAL mobile app, moving from UI/UX polishing to new feature implementation and finally to deep stability testing and bug-fixing.

Initially, the work focused on a multi-stage UI polish phase, systematically refining screens like , , , and  based on iterative user feedback to improve spacing, scrolling, and layout consistency. A key pattern established was the use of a  parameter to standardize navigation.

Following the UI polish, the project moved to **Phase 2: Content Population**, where real JSON data for outfits was loaded into the MongoDB database via a new Python script (), bringing the Style feature to life.

**Phase 3** involved building the new Beauty tab from scratch. This included creating backend endpoints in , a new  MongoDB collection, frontend screens (, ), and loading initial data.

The final and most recent stage was **Phase 4: Stability Testing & Debugging**. This phase uncovered and resolved several critical bugs:
1.  An invalid TMDB API key in the frontend was causing movie search to fail.
2.  Movie poster recognition was failing due to a  upload issue; this was fixed by migrating to a -based upload, mirroring the app's music recognition flow.
3.  The poster recognition feature was ultimately paused by the user to focus on the MVP.
4.  A bug in the music search backend endpoint was fixed.
5.  A misunderstanding about the clickability of Style/Beauty cards led to a brief debugging session, which was concluded after user clarification.

<product_requirements>
The project, REVEAL, is a multi-faceted mobile discovery app for iOS and Android, designed to provide a premium, polished user experience.

**Implemented Features:**
1.  **Music Reveal**: An instant song identification feature (Shazam-like) that provides results with full lyrics and streaming links.
2.  **Movie Reveal**: Functionality to search movies by title. The original image-based search was paused to focus on the MVP. The app also features Discover, Coming Soon, and movie detail pages with Where to Watch info.
3.  **Style/Outfits**: A fashion discovery hub with categories (Streetwear, Luxury, etc.), populated with 10 real outfits. It displays item-by-item breakdowns and a Budget Alternatives section.
4.  **Beauty**: A complete tab for makeup discovery, populated with 15 celebrity looks. It features product breakdowns and Budget Dupes across categories like Natural and Glam.
5.  **Unified Discover Hub**: A central tab with horizontally scrolling sections for trending content.

**Overall Status:** The application is considered feature-complete for its MVP stage. All core sections (Movies, Music, Style, Beauty) are built, populated with initial data, and have undergone extensive UI polishing and stability testing.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React Native, Expo,  for file-based navigation.
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI, Pydantic for data validation.
- **Database**: MongoDB for Style and Beauty content.
- **APIs**: AudD (Music), TMDB (Movies), Google Vision (Image Recognition - paused).
- **File Uploads**:  string encoding for audio and image submissions to the backend.
- **Navigation**: A  parameter is passed via  to manage back navigation consistently.
- **UI**: Heavy use of , , and  for creating responsive, polished layouts.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a  Expo app and a  FastAPI service.



**File Change Summary:**

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core of the application's logic.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified. Added a full suite of endpoints for the Beauty feature (). Fixed a music search bug by adding a  Pydantic model. Improved the  endpoint with a fallback to recommendations. Added a  endpoint to fix image upload issues.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles movie search via text and the (now-paused) poster recognition feature.
    -   **Changes**: The text search was fixed by adding a dedicated  function and UI button. The image recognition feature was temporarily removed from the UI by commenting out the From Gallery and From Camera buttons to focus on the MVP. Debugging s were added and later removed.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes all frontend API calls.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to use the new  endpoint, converting the image to a  string before sending. A hardcoded, invalid TMDB API key was removed, ensuring movie searches rely on the backend.

-   ** & **:
    -   **Importance**: Main screens for the Style and Beauty features.
    -   **Changes**: The user reported that cards were unclickable. An investigation began by adding  to a  and then adding debug s to the  handlers. It was later clarified by the user that this was a misunderstanding, and the cards were not meant to be clickable yet. All debugging code was subsequently removed from these files.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Root navigation file.
    -   **Changes**: The Beauty tab was added to the main  navigator. The  screen was configured to not show in the tab bar.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Add Product/Outfit Linking**: Implement navigation or linking from Style and Beauty item cards to detail pages or external URLs, as this functionality is currently not implemented.
- **Build Out Explore Pages**: Create the full pages for Discover New Brands, Discover New Music, and Movie Genres linked from the Discover tab.
- **Re-enable Poster Recognition**: Re-visit and fully debug the image picker functionality for the movie poster recognition feature.
- **Implement Skincare Section**: Add a skincare section to the Beauty tab as originally planned.
- **Add User Favorites**: Implement functionality for users to save favorite outfits or beauty looks.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was investigating a user report that cards in the **Style** and **Beauty** sections were not clickable. This was a high-priority bug hunt.

**Initial Actions:**
1.  The AI engineer suspected an overlay was blocking touch events and applied  to the  component in  and .
2.  When that didn't resolve the issue, the engineer added temporary s inside the  handlers of the  components in both files to determine if the press events were firing at all.

**Resolution:**
The user then clarified that this was a misunderstanding on their part. The cards were **not supposed to be clickable yet**, as the feature for linking to products or detail pages had not been requested or implemented.

**Final Action:**
Following the user's clarification, the AI engineer's last action was to clean up the code by removing the temporary debugging s from  and , restoring them to their previous state. The application is now stable, with this bug confirmed as a non-issue. The user is currently testing the overall stability of the MVP.
